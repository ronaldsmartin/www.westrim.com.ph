description: "WestRim worked alongside Disney’s Imagineering team, Architects Hawai’i, Ltd., and environmental experts on Oahu to produce a master engineering plan for their first LEED® certified resort.


WestRim implemented several notable energy conservation design strategies. Foremost among them is a cooling system that chills the entire facility with circulating groundwater drawn from two deep supply wells. The system simultaneously harvests the heat emitted from the resort’s large chillers and diverts it to heat the whirlpool spas and swimming pools."
