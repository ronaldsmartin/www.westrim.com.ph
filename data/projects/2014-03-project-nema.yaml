description: "NEMA is part of a new generation of high-rise residential developments in San Francisco. The 754-unit complex lies in the center of the burgeoning Mid-Market neighborhood. It caters to a younger, tech-savvy crowd with a world-class array of services, amenities, and community-making experiences.

Crescent Heights cycled through two architects—for whom WestRim delivered two full sets of MEP designs—before they settled on the right architectural lead. In 2009, San Francisco’s Handel Architects came aboard. Their design included four connected towers, ranging from 10 to 37 floors.

Our central engineering challenge was space efficiency. The planned amenities, which occupied a full 30,000 sq. ft., included a 60-foot saltwater pool and outdoor film screening area—plus a suite of tech conveniences, like full-coverage high-speed WiFi, keyless entry, and a digital mobile antenna. It was a feat to configure the requisite MEP systems to fit in the space that was left."
