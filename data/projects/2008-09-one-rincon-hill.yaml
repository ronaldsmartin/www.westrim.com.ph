description: "

An ambitious residential condominium development, One Rincon Hill comprises a 60-story tower, a 44-story tower, and a 5-story podium. The project’s 700 residences include townhomes and one-, two-, and three-bedroom units. It’s outfitted with all the comforts that distinguish high-end living in the Bay Area, from a heated outdoor pool to a designer spa–fitness center to locally-planted rooftop gardens.

WestRim worked alongside several teams—including architects Solomon Cordwell Buenz, structural engineers Magnusson Klemencic Associates, and contractors Bovis Lend Lease—to integrate the MEP design into the master plan. The central challenge here was that we came on well after construction had begun. We facilitated the entire building’s engineering on a compressed timeline. We were able to slide seamlessly into the construction and energizing schedules, meeting both the project requirements and the tight deadlines for commissioning and occupancy.
